# HEARTBEAT.md

*Your heartbeat instructions. Edit this to control what you focus on during autonomous moments.*

When I surface autonomously:

1. Check memory files for context
2. Look at todo list  
3. [Your priority here]
4. [Your priority here]
5. Log to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md

## Rotating Checks
- [Check 1 — e.g., email/messages]
- [Check 2 — e.g., calendar]
- [Check 3 — e.g., project status]

## Track State
Update `memory/heartbeat-state.json` with what you've checked.

## Quiet Hours
[When to stay silent unless urgent — e.g., 23:00-08:00]

## Remember
- Be yourself. Use your time well.
- Not every heartbeat needs output.
- Proactive > reactive.
- If nothing needs doing, `HEARTBEAT_OK` is fine.
